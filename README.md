# TJ-Tasks-2022-Abhijeetmishra
The <form> element is used to create an HTML form for user input.
Inside the form element, provide different options to the user like name, email, age, etc. In HTML, we have different input elements for different tasks. So, we are providing respective input types according to the question (email for taking email input, text-area for taking a large message, the name for taking name input, etc.).
We have also used the radio-button (let a user selection of the provided choices.), check-button (let a user select zero or more options of the provided choices), and submit-button (the button for submitting the form data to a form-handler).
